This repository contains the source code for Computerized Health Record to store a person's health information. It consits of 3 separate code files; 
1. main.cpp which is the main application that prompts a person for their information, instantiates an object of class Health Profile for that person and prints the information from that object.
2. HealthProfile.h is the header file that allows the class HealthProfile to be used in main.cpp
3. HealthProfile.cpp is the HealthProfile class itself fully defined.
